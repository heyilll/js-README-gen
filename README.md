## <a id="description"></a> Description
My task was to create a command-line application using Javascript given starter code. It should generate professional README files through multiple prompts to the user, which saves time for working on their project. The requirements were: 

* Create a command-line application that accepts user input.
  * When a user is prompted for information about the application repository then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with:
    * The title of my project 
    * Sections entitled:
      * Description 
      * Table of Contents 
      * Installation 
      * Usage 
      * License 
      * Contributing 
      * Tests 
      * Questions
    * When a user enters the project title then it is displayed as the title of the README
    * When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
    * When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled **License** that explains which license the application is covered under
    * When a user enters their GitHub username then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile
    * When a user enters their email address then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions
    * When a user clicks on the links in the **Table of Contents** then they are taken to the corresponding section of the README
